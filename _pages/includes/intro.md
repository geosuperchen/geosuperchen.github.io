I am now working on 3D GIS model about image understanding and explicit reasong, water environment by RS technology.

I graduated from [LIESMARS](https://liesmars.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University (武汉大学) with a master's degree, advised by [Kaimin SUN](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/sunkaimin/zh_CN/index.htm). I also collaborate with [XXX (XXX)](XXXXXXX), and [Tie-yan Liu (刘铁岩)](XXXXX) from [XXX](XXXXX) <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely. 

My research interest includes 3D GIS, deep learning and water environment.
